# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
ML4Dynamics addresses the growing need to combine traditional numerical methods with machine learning approaches in scientific computing. As simulations of complex physical systems become more computationally intensive, there's a need for techniques that can maintain physical accuracy while improving computational efficiency.

## Problems It Solves

### Distribution Shift in Hybrid Simulations
- **Challenge**: When machine learning models are trained on specific simulation conditions but used in different regimes, their performance degrades due to distribution shift.
- **Solution**: The project implements tangent-space regularization algorithms to make ML models more robust to distribution shifts.

### Computational Efficiency
- **Challenge**: High-fidelity simulations of complex dynamics (like fluid dynamics) require significant computational resources.
- **Solution**: ML-augmented simulations that can maintain accuracy while reducing computational requirements.

### Bridging Numerical Methods and Machine Learning
- **Challenge**: Traditional numerical methods and machine learning approaches have different strengths and weaknesses.
- **Solution**: A framework that integrates both approaches, leveraging their complementary strengths.

## How It Should Work
1. **Data Generation**: Generate high-fidelity simulation data using traditional numerical methods
