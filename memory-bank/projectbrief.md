# ML4Dynamics Project Brief

## Project Overview
ML4Dynamics is a scientific computing project focused on machine learning for dynamics simulation, particularly for partial differential equations (PDEs) and dynamical systems. The project implements various numerical methods and machine learning models to simulate, analyze, and improve computational fluid dynamics and other physical simulations.

## Core Goals
1. Mitigate distribution shift in machine learning-augmented hybrid simulation
2. Implement efficient numerical solvers for PDEs (Navier-Stokes, reaction-diffusion, etc.)
3. Apply machine learning techniques to improve simulation accuracy and efficiency
4. Develop tangent-space regularized algorithms for machine learning in hybrid simulations

## Key Components
- Dynamics simulators for various physical systems
- Neural network models for augmenting traditional simulations
- Data processing utilities for simulation inputs/outputs
- Visualization tools for simulation results
- Training procedures for machine learning models

## Technical Requirements
- High numerical accuracy for physical simulations
- Efficient implementation of PDE solvers
- JAX-based neural network implementations
- Support for both 1D and 2D simulations
- Configurable model architectures (e.g., UNet with customizable kernel sizes)

## Project Scope
The project focuses on the intersection of scientific computing and machine learning, with particular emphasis on improving simulation accuracy through ML techniques while addressing the challenge of distribution shift when ML models are applied to scenarios outside their training distribution.
